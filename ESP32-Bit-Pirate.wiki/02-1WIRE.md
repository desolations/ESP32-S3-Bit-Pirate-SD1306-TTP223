# 1WIRE Mode

This mode allows communication with devices using the 1-Wire protocol, such as iButtons, EEPROM or temperature sensors (e.g. DS18B20).

| `write id [8 bytes]`    | Programs a new ROM ID to a supported device, prompt for 8 bytes if not given                      |
| `write sp [8 bytes]`    | Writes 8 bytes to the scratchpad memory (via 0x0F command), , prompt for 8 bytes if not given                           |
| `ibutton`          | Open an interactive shell to copy, read and write iButtons (RW1990) |
| `eeprom`          | Open an interactive shell to dump, read write, analyze and erase EEPROM (DS24/28) |
| `temp`                  | Reads and decodes the temperature from a connected DS18B20 sensor                      |
| `config`                | Lets you change the data pin used for 1-Wire communication                           |
| `[0xAA r:8]` ...        | Allows sending manual 1-Wire instructions with precise control over command flow     |

## ⚙️ 1-Wire EEPROM Shell
The **`eeprom`** command provides an interactive environment to explore, manage, and erase 1-Wire EEPROM chips.

### Actions

- 🔍 **Probe EEPROM** – Detects the connected 1-Wire EEPROM and identifies its model and size.
- 📊 **Analyze EEPROM** – Scans the contents for data summary.
- 📖 **Read bytes** – Reads a sequence of bytes starting at a given memory address.
- ✏️ **Write bytes** – Writes one or more bytes to a specific address, with automatic page handling.
- 🗃️ **Dump EEPROM** – Outputs the entire EEPROM contents in hex dump format.
- 💣 **Erase EEPROM** – Wipes the chip by writing 0x00 across all pages.
- 🚪 **Exit Shell** – Leaves the 1-Wire EEPROM shell and returns to the previous menu.



### Supported Models

| Model      | Capacity | Page Size | Family Code | CRC16 | Notes                              |
|------------|----------|-----------|-------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| DS2431     | 128 B    | 8 B       | `0x2D`      | ✅     | 1 Kbit – 4 pages of 8 bytes         |
| DS2433     | 512 B    | 32 B      | `0x23`      | ✅     | 4 Kbit – 16 pages of 32 bytes       |
| DS28EC20   | 2560 B   | 32 B      | `0x43`      | ✅     | 20 Kbit – 80 pages of 32 bytes      |

- Only one device should be present on the 1-Wire bus during operations.  
- Pull-up resistor is required on the **DQ** (IO) line.

## 📝 Notes

- You can use `scan` to discover devices like DS18B20 or iButtons.
- The `read` command shows the device's ID and scratchpad if supported.
- The `write id` and `write sp` commands expect **8 bytes** in hex format (e.g. `write id 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05 0x0 0x07 0x08`).
- Without data provided, the `write id|sp` commands will prompt for 8 bytes.
- The `ibutton` implementation follows the **official Dallas 1-Wire protocol** for ID programming, including the proper timing sequence and command structure.
- Prefers USB Serial over WiFi web to copy ibuttons, the timing is critical and the web server could disturb the copy.
- `sniff` is useful when passively monitoring a 1-Wire bus connected to another master device.   It attempts to **automatically detect known 1-Wire timing patterns**, including **reset pulses**, **presence responses**, and **bit-slots**, to reconstruct readable transactions.
- `ibutton` Operations on Rom ID for classic iButtons. Works with RW1990 tag (rewrittable)
- The instruction syntax (`[0x... r:N]`) allows precise control of low-level communication, including bit-level reads, delays, and raw hex sequences.



## 📌 Example Usage

```bash
mode 1wire
scan
read
sniff
write id 0x1 0x2 0x3 0x4 0x5 0x6 0x7 0x8
write id # Prompt for 8 bytes: AA BB 01...
write sp
write sp 0xDE 0xCD 0xAA 0x4 0x5 0x6 0x7 0x8
temp
ibutton   # open interactive shell
eeprom    # open interactive shell
[0x33 r:8] # Send read cmd and read 8 bytes
```
