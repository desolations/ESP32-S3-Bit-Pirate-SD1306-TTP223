# UART Mode

UART mode allows communication over a standard serial interface using TX/RX pins.  
This mode is useful for probing unknown serial devices, sending and receiving data, or bridging traffic.

## 📝 Notes

- `scan` analyzes a group of pin to detect uart activity.
- `autobaud` detects the baudrate on RX by counting edge timings
- `ping` sends predefined probes and analyzes responses to detect UART activity.
- `spam` can send special chars like \n.
- `bridge` connects the terminal input/output to the device in real-time. Press any ESP32 button to stop.
- `at` works with various devices. Each device has its own command set: not all commands are universal.
- `xmodem` send and receive operations require an SD card, as files are read from or written to the SD.
- `xmodem`  at 115200 baud (≈11.5 kB/s), transferring a 1 MB file over XMODEM takes approximately 90 seconds.
- `config` supports full UART parameter customization:
  - RX/TX pins
  - Baudrate
  - Data bits (5–8)
  - Parity (None, Even, Odd)
  - Stop bits (1 or 2)
  - Inversion (for certain logic-level devices)
- The custom instruction syntax (`['Hello' r:64]`) lets you build sequences of writes, delays, and reads manually.


## 📌 Example Usage

```bash
mode uart
config                 # Configure pins and settings
scan                   # Try to find the right baud rate
ping                   # Send probes for a response
write AT               # Send AT text
write                  # Enter write prompt mode
write Hello\n          # Send Hello with a line return
read                   # View device output
bridge                 # Real-time serial passthrough
spam Hello 1000        # Write Hello every second
spam \n 5              # Send ENTER every 5ms
swap                   # RX and TX swap
xmodem send /file.txt  # Send a file via XMODEM from SD
xmodem recv /file.txt  # Receive a file via XMODEM to SD
['AT' r:64]            # Send 'AT' and read 64 bytes
```
