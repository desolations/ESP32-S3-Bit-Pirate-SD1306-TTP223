# SubGHz Mode

Sub-GHz refers to radio frequencies below 1 GHz—common bands including **315 MHz**, **433 MHz**, **868 MHz (EU)** and **902–928 MHz (US)**. This mode works with the **CC1101** sub‑GHz radio module.

| `load`                          | Load and select `.sub` files from the [LittleFS storage](https://github.com/geo-tp/ESP32-Bus-Pirate/wiki/99-LittleFS)  ⚠️
| `ear`       | Convert real-time RSSI variations from the SubGHz radio into audible tones (choose frequency and threshold)
| `setfrequency` | Set the operating **frequency** (choose a band list or enter a **Custom** MHz value) |
| `config`       | Interactive setup of **SPI pins** and **GDO0**, then initializes CC1101 |

## ⚠️ Important Warning (Jamming / Transmission)

- Emitting RF energy may be **regulated or illegal** in your jurisdiction without a license or outside ISM limits.  
- **Jamming** can interfere with legitimate devices (alarms, remotes, sensors). Use **only in controlled lab environments** and ensure compliance with local laws.  
- Keep output power and duty cycle minimal when testing. You are responsible for how you use these features.



## ⚙️ `config`

**Configure the CC1101 pins/params:**
- **CS** (CSN, Chip Select)
- **SCK / MISO / MOSI**
- **GDO0** (data pin)
- **VCC** 3.3v
- **CC1101 Pinout**

## 📂 Load (`.sub` files)

The `load` command can play back Sub-GHz files from the [**Flipper Sub-GHz DB**](https://github.com/Zero-Sploit/FlipperZero-Subghz-DB).

### How it works (quick start)
1. **Upload the file(s)**  
   In the Web UI, open  [**Files → LittleFS**](https://github.com/geo-tp/ESP32-Bus-Pirate/wiki/99-LittleFS) and drop your `.sub` files.  

2. **Load from the device**  
   In SubGHz mode, run:
   ```bash
   load
   ```
   - Pick a `.sub` from the list.
   - You can send frames by selecting the index.

3. **Transmit**  
   Auto-configure the CC1101 from the file’s metadata (frequency, preset, protocol).  
   If multiple frames are present, you can iterate and replay as needed.


## 📝 Notes

- **TI CC1101** modules are inexpensive and widely available.  
- `scan` and `sweep` help discover active carriers; `sweep` gives a more nuanced **confidence** estimation by combining peak level and activity ratio.  
- A few **kHz offset** can degrade reception; fine‑tune around the discovered peak.  
- To discover a device’s frequency: run `scan`, repeatedly press the remote or listen the signal for a few seconds, then stop and pick the highest peak frequency.  
- `bruteforce` is an adapted version from the Bruce firmware (https://github.com/pr3y/Bruce).
- `ear` uses the I2S pins for audio output, which are configured by default if a speaker is present on the device.
- For better reliability, prefer **USB Serial** logging over Wi‑Fi (lower latency).


## 📌 Example Usage

```bash
config               # Configure SPI pins and GDO0, initialize CC1101
setfrequency         # Choose a band or enter a custom MHz value
scan                 # Scan band and print RSSI peaks (press ENTER to stop)
sweep                # Slow sweep with activity/confidence per frequency
sniff                # Raw pulse capture at current freq (press ENTER to stop)
trace                # Live logic trace of GDO0 on device screen
waterfall            # Live frequency peaks on a specified range
send 0x123456 150    # Send the payload with TE 150ms as base time
receive              # Raw or guess encoding/bitrate/protocol from a captured frame
replay               # Capture frame then replay it
record               # Capture frame and save it to the LittleFS
bruteforce           # Try fixed-code space for selected protocol (lab only)
jam                  # Choose a frequency/band and start jamming (lab only)
load                 # Load .sub files from LittleFS
ear               # RSSI variation to audio tone
```
